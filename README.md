# Snake

A simple Snake game I built in high school using Java.  
The player controls a snake that grows longer when it eats food.  
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

to run:
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in a Java IDE
3. Run the main 'SnakeGame.java' class to start the game.
